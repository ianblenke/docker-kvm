# QEMU/KVM on Docker and CoreOS

## Usage

0. `docker pull ianblenke/qemu`
0. `docker run --privileged ianblenke/qemu /usr/bin/kvm QEMU_OPTIONS`

Note that `--privileged` is required in order to run with the kernel-level virtualization (kvm) optimization.


## Background
For the most part, it is fairly easy to run qemu within docker.  The only real hiccup is that /dev/kvm (the device node for the kernel hypervisor access) isn't reissued (or permitted) within docker.  That means we have to do two things for basic usage:

0.  Make the device node
0.  Execute the docker container with `--privileged`

While this is obviously not ideal, it isn't actually _that_ bad, since you are running a full VM, in the container, which _itself_ should isolate the client.

## Why

Sometimes you need to orchestrate immutable windows instances, and Windows Server Containers aren't available yet.

## Networking

The entrypoint script allows you to pass the `$BRIDGE_IF` environment variable.  If set, it will add that bridge interface to the container's `/etc/qemu/bridge.conf` file which, in turn, allow your qemu instance to attach to that bridge using the built-in `qemu-bridge-helper`.

Note, however, that if you want to do this, you'll need to pass the `--net=host` option to your `docker run` command, in order to access the host's networking namespace.

## Service file

Also included in this repo is a service file, suitable for use with systemd (CoreOS and fleet), provided as an example.  You'll need to fill in your own values, of course, and customize it to your liking.
